  ```
- Generate a new migration file
  ```sh
  make diff
  ```
- Run migrations
  ```sh
  docker compose exec apache php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
  ```
- Load development fixtures
  ```sh
  docker compose exec apache php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load --group=dev --no-interaction
  ```

  ```sh
  make drop-db
  ```
- **Remove all migration files:** (Useful for resetting migrations in development)
  ```sh
  make rm-migrations
  ```
